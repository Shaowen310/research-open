# Reinforcement Learning

## Introduction

Give an environment, an agent learns from the rewards and punishments of its actions and tries to find an action model that would maximise its total cumulative reward.

### Problem Formulation

#### Definitions

1. Environment: The world where the agent operates
2. State: The variables which describe the agent's situation at a certain time
3. Reward: The feedback of the agent's action from the environment
4. Policy: The method to map the agent's state to actions
5. Value: The expected reward that the agent would receive by taking an action at a certain state

#### Frameworks

**Model-based**

Markov Decision Processes \(MDPs\)

**Model-free**

\(Not involving transition probability distribution and the reward function\)

Q-learning
