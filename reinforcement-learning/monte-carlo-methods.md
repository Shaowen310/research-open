# Monte Carlo Methods

## Introduction

Monte Carlo methods estimate value functions and determine optimal policies by **sample sequences of state, actions and rewards** from the agent's interaction with the environment. It does **not** require knowledge of the **environment's dynamics** which include the complete probability distributions of all possible transitions.
