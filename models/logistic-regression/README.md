# Logistic Regression

The output of the model is the estimated probability.

It is used for binary classification. For data with more than 2 classes, softmax regression has to be used.

## Model

$$
h(x) = \text{sigmoid}(wx+b)
$$

### Sigmoid function

$$
\text{sigmoid}(t) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-t}}
$$

## Training objective



Objective function

Convex programming

Optimiser choices: gradient descent, Newton's method
